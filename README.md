:x: Error was thrown in the solana program when only one option with no commas was provided. It does not make sense for vote topics to be provided with only one option and so this is to prevent admins from creating such voting topics. 

:eight_pointed_black_star: The solana-voting program can also be filtered for vote topics such as 'Next president for 2022' which is shown below with its respective options.
